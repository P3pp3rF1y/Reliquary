Reliquary
=========

The offical repository of Reliquary! That mod, with the magical swag, and a weapon, and stuff.

Originally made by x3n0ph0b3, now maintained by TheMike.

Building
=========

As of 1.6.4-1.1, we use GMCP's code system. Follow this guide for building using GMCP.

Versioning
=========

I'm eventually heading to a 1.7.x-2.0 release, using 1.6.4-1.0 as a base and building up from there. Versioning and downloads is provided by Github and used client-side by ModStats.

Licence
=========

The licence is located at COPYING.txt, but to save you the trouble, it's GPLv3. 

Basically, do whatever you want, as long as it's free, open source, and stays under GPL. (Yes, that allows you to use it in your modpack.)
